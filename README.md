# PushPushDelta
A mobile game prototype I made for Android in a couple of days. Might come back to it later, but currently not being worked on.

##Gameplay Notes
The objective of the game is to capture as many monsters as possible within the time frame. You can do that by clicking on the nets when a monster is on top of it.
You can also push monsters by holding down your finger on the screen, and waiting until the white circle is about the same size as the red circle.

##Monster Types
* Green Guys: Just walks around.
* Golden Guys: The same as the green guys, but moves a bit faster.
* Blue Bird Guys: Jumps around the field. You can only push them when they're on the ground.


##Notes
* There's a couple time-based social game features that are implemented, which you can generally ignore since they're a bit buggy right now. 
* The main game can be reached by pressing "level select", then "Template Level".
